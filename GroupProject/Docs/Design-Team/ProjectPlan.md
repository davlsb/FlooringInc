# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 5: Liza Hashani, Tanvir Sami, Albi Xhuveli, David Slawotsky

##  1 Introduction

Our app makes it simple and easy to search and track inventory of flooring products for each store in Flooring Icon Inc.


## 2 Process Description

As a team we will use the phases of the software development life cycle in the process of creating our application. We produce the concepts and analyze the requirements needed. We form architectural and detailed designs of both internal and external structure as well as thoroughly planning their functionality. Lastly we implement code, debug, and test our final result.

**Inception**
- The team makes note of the requirements from the owners. We analyzed the specifications, and established clear goals for each process to be completed in order to have a working design and functionality.
- The entrance criteria for this phase are the concepts and requirements analysis. We also plan out development and correction costs, analyze any risk factors, and design general architectures of the software.
- The exit criteria for this phase consists of all the documents forming our software concepts and scope such as a project plan, use-case model, risk assessments, and business case. 

**Elaboration**
- In the elaboration phase we use our previous documentation to further design a more detailed outline and elaborate on supplementary requirements, dependencies, and operations. Multiple diagrams are created to organize the software’s components and deployment with detailed documentation. We check that these all meet the requirements.
- The entrance criteria of this phase is all that is described above.
- The exit criteria here is having solid design models for the UI, hardware and software structures, as well as all test cases prepared.

**Construction**
- In the construction phase all team members will use the architectural designs from our elaboration to begin the code implementation and building the interface. We develop all features within the working system with all the functional and technical requirements. All the functional requirements are tested.
- The entrance criteria of this phase are the above details. The prototype, or initial version of the app, should be executed. Requirements can be refined as well.
- The exit criteria for this phase is that the software application is completed and functions as needed on the android device. A user manual should also be constructed and finalized. All testing strategies are performed with available results. 

**Transition**
- In the transition phase, we catch any software issues or bugs. This is when beta testing will be performed, meaning it will be tested and validated by users/employees. We want to ensure that the app is user-friendly, functional, and efficient. 
- The entrance criteria for this phase is the final version of the application. Final edits are made to the documentation. The improved tests should provide final and successful results.
- The exit criteria is that our Flooring Inc application is completed and can be used.
